                <p class="text-content">
                    From a young age, I've always been driven by curiosity and a desire to learn. My journey has taken me from hands-on work in cable installation, where I connected people to the digital world, to my new adventure in software development. I believe in blending my real-world experience with new technical skills to build meaningful and practical applications.<br><br>I came to Pursuit seeking to further my software development journey, knowing only the basics. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React are my focus now. I believe in the power of code to create innovative solutions and am excited to embark on this journey of creating a positive impact. With a strong foundation in problem-solving and a passion for technology, I am ready to take on new challenges and contribute to a world that is constantly being shaped by innovation.
