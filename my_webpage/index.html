                <p class="text-content">
                    From a young age, I've always been driven by curiosity and a desire to learn. My journey has taken me from hands-on work in cable installation, where I connected people to the digital world, to my new adventure in software development. I believe in blending my real-world experience with new technical skills to build meaningful and practical applications.<br><br>I came to Pursuit seeking to further my software development journey, knowing only the basics. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React were all self-taught through an online bootcamp, a process that took me around two years on and off. I even learned how to type from scratch. I would also like to take this time to confess something I hold near and dear to my heart: my sobriety. I had an alcohol problem, and that’s part of the reason why it took me so long to learn the fundamentals of coding. I’m also proud to announce that I have been sober for over ten months now. Since then, I have made several attempts at finding something I’m truly passionate about. That includes tennis and pickleball, among other recreational activities. The one true passion I landed on is running. Even though there are days when I don’t want to do it, I still get it done. Once the rubber hits the road, it’s like all the mayhem life throws at us temporarily disappears. I’m also what you would call a thrill-seeker. I remember I went skydiving once, and it was one of the most liberating things I’ve ever done.<br><br>Finally, I’d like to mention that I’ve been blown away by the amount of additional technical skills I’ve learned here at Pursuit in only two weeks. That includes AI prompting, GitHub, and deployment. Most of all, I’ve learned to appreciate the power of collaboration. Learning together has been the most rewarding part of it all. I look forward to the months ahead. Together, along with the revolutionary tool that is AI, we can achieve our goals.
