                <p class="text-content">
                    From a young age, I've always been driven by curiosity and a desire to learn. My journey has taken me from hands-on work in cable installation, where I connected people to the digital world, to my new adventure in software development. I believe in blending my real-world experience with new technical skills to build meaningful and practical applications.

                    I came to Pursuit seeking to further my software development journey, knowing only the basics. HTML, CSS and Javascript was self taught through an online bootcamp. That took me two years on and off. Mind you I even learned how to type from scratch. I’ve been blown away by the amount of additional technical skills I’ve learned here at Pursuit in only two weeks. That includes AI prompting, GitHub and deployment. Most of all, I’ve learned to appreciate the power of collaboration. Learning together has been the most rewarding part of it all. I look forward to the months ahead. Together along with the revolutionary tool that is AI we can achieve our goals.
